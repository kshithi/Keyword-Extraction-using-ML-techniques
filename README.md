Introduction
Nowadays there are plenty of legal documents available in electronic format. Therefore, legal scholars and practitioners are in need of systems able to search and quantify semantic details of these documents. Legitimate information and common laws are available in raw form and hard to understand since they are not in organized form. All legitimate information is nowadays computerized since the legal information gets generated frequently in a large volume due to the increase of law courts. The purpose of this research is to explore an efficient way to implement an algorithm to identify keywords by predicting the relevance of legal documents from a huge file system which is difficult to do manually.

The machine learning and deep learning algorithms based analysis systems apply these methods mainly for document classification. Legal document classification, translation, summarization, data obtainment are part of the goals obtained from this research. In this study, we review the different methods of deep learning used in legal tasks such as Legal data search, Legal document analytics, and Legal perspective interface. Through this review, we instituted that machine learning models are giving advanced performance.

Project Background
Finding database and e-Resource that provide legal and legislative information is vital need for lawyers of Sri Lanka.There are current implementations but those systems does not come up with efficient solution.There also manual work is costly.We need to reduce man work from the beginning of the portal.To implement user friendly and a system which learn itself to categorize documents the keyword extraction is essential.

Our client also required a machine learning module which can provide efficieny and accuracy keyword extraction and searching ability.
